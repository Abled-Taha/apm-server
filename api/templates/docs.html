  <h2>Config File</h2>

  <br>
  <h4>Django Secret Key</h4>
  <p>Django uses a secret key, which can be found in the config.json file of this project and the default one should not be used 
    in any case. To generate a new django secret key, you can use any online generator like 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://djecrety.ir/">DJECRETY</a>. The other method to generate a secret key is by command line which
    I would not be covering.</p>

  <br>
  <h4>Debug Mode</h4>
  <p>This is a Boolean (True / False) value which can be set in the project's config.json file. It needs to be set to FALSE for 
    normal use. If set to TRUE, it may help you debug the application but shows many things which should be public in any case.
    So, other than when running the API in a development environment, the value should be set to FALSE.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4>Supply GUI Response</h4>
  <p>
    This is a Boolean (True / False) value which can be set in the project's config.json file. If the API should not allow any GET
    requests then this variable should be set to False otherwise it can be left to True. When set to True the API will also respond
    to GET requests and return HTML pages.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4>Host DB</h4>
  <p>This is a variable of type STRING, it contains the IP of the host on which the MongoDB is running. If the database is running
    on the same machine as the API, the value of it can be set to 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4>Port DB</h4>
  <p>
    This is a variable of type STRING, it contains the PORT on which the MongoDB is listening. The default port for MongoDB is '27017'.
    If the default port for the database is left untouched when setting it up, this variable can be left untouched also or be set to 
    '27017'.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4>Name DB</h4>
  <p>
    This is a variable of type STRING, it contains the name of the dabase in a MongoDB cluster. If the exact instructions are followed
    from the README.md file of this project then this variable can be left untouched.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4>Username</h4>
  <p>
    This is a variable of type STRING, it contains the name of the user which has rights to READ & Write to the database. If the
    exact instructions are followed from the README.md file of this project then this variable can be left untouched.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4>PWD</h4>
  <p>
    This is a variable of type STRING, it contains the password of the user which accesses the database. The password is set when 
    creating this user. If the README.md file has been followed then the password which had been set at the time of setting up
    the user should be set in this field also.
  </p>
