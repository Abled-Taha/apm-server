        The "<span class="span-important">config.json</span>" file contains the config for the API.
        It is located at "<span class="span-important">Project_Directory/config.json</span>" (Root Directory of Project).
        It can be edited according to the user's needs.
        Some of the fields in it are required to be changed by the user so the API can function correctly and securely.

        Below is the description of the entirety of the config file and the entire guide for it.

            <p>Data Type: Boolean</p>
            <p>
              This field determines that should the API run in debug mode or not.
              When in debug mode, the API, on encountering errors, may print out additional information in the browser which is a critical security risk.
              In normal circumstances, this field should be set to "<span class="span-important">false</span>".

            <p>
              This field contains the Secret Key of Django.
              When setting up this project, the user needs to change this field.
              A new secret key can be generated by using an online django Secret Key Generator.
              For example, the user can use this <span class="span-important"><a href="https://djecrety.ir/" class="anchor-link">Generator</a></span>.

            <p>Data Type: Array</p>
            <p>
              This field contains the list of hosts which can serve the API.
              This field must be changed after setting the "<span class="span-important">debug</span>" to "<span class="span-important">true</span>".
              <span class="span-important">["127.0.0.1"]</span> this can be used if the API is served locally or the ip can be substituted for the host name or DNS if the API is being served and hosted on a server.
              For example, <span class="span-important">["example.com"]</span> can be used if the server serving the API has a DNS of "<span class="span-important">example.com</span>".
              At last, <span class="span-important">["*"]</span> this wildcard can be used to allow anyone to serve this API, but it may pose some security risks.

              These Fields contain the IP and PORT of the machine running the DB.
              If the DB is running locally and the PORT is not changed then the default value would already work.
