# Config

The "**config.json**" file contains the config for the API. It is located at "**Project_Directory/config.json**" (Root Directory of Project). It can be edited according to the user's needs. Some of the fields in it are required to be changed by the user so the API can function correctly and securely.

Below is the description of the entirety of the config file and the entire guide for it.

## Config File Fields

1.  **debug:**
    *   Data Type: Boolean
    *   This field determines that should the API run in debug mode or not. When in debug mode, the API, on encountering errors, may print out additional information in the browser which is a critical security risk. In normal circumstances, this field should be set to "**false**".

2.  **security\_key: (MUST BE CHANGED)**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   This field contains the Secret Key of Django. When setting up this project, the user needs to change this field. A new secret key can be generated by using an online django Secret Key Generator. For example, the user can use this [Generator](https://djecrety.ir/).

3.  **allowed\_hosts: (MUST BE CHANGED)**
    *   Data Type: Array
    *   This field contains the list of hosts which can serve the API. This field must be changed after setting the "**debug**" to "**true**". 
        *   "**\["127.0.0.1"\]**" this can be used if the API is served locally or the ip can be substituted for the host name or DNS if the API is being served and hosted on a server.
        *   For example, "**\["example.com"\]**" can be used if the server serving the API has a DNS of "**example.com**".
        *   At last, "**\["*"\]**" this wildcard can be used to allow anyone to serve this API, but it may pose some security risks.

4.  **db\_host | db\_port**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   These Fields contain the IP and PORT of the machine running the DB. If the DB is running locally and the PORT is not changed then the default value would already work.

5.  **db\_username | db\_password**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   These Fields contain the Username and Password of the user which has the rights to access the DB. If the REAMD.md file is followed exactly then these fields should not be changed in the config.

6.  **db\_name**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   This field contains the name of the DB which is used to store the data of the Application. If the REAMD.md file is followed exactly then this field should not be changed in the config.

7.  **db\_srv**
    *   Data Type: Boolean
    *   This field contains the bool to check if the db connections uses srv or not. These can be changed but are not necessary to do so.

8.  **server\_host | server\_port**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   This field contains the host and the port of the api on which the api would be served. These can be changed but are not necessary to do so.

9.  **username\_min\_length | username\_max\_length**
    *   Data Type: Integer
    *   These fields determine, when a user creates a new account and sets up a username, what the minimum and maximum length of the username should be. These can be changed but are not necessary to do so.

10. **password\_min\_length | password\_max\_length**
    *   Data Type: Integer
    *   These fields determine, when a user creates a new account and sets up a password, what the minimum and maximum length of the password should be. These can be changed but are not necessary to do so.

11. **sessionId\_length**
    *   Data Type: Integer
    *   When a user login into the account, he is allotted a new session id. This field determines the length of that session id. This can be changed but are not necessary and recommended to do so.

12. **salt\_length**
    *   Data Type: Integer
    *   When a user creates an account, a new salt is generated. This field determines the length of that salt. This can be changed but is not necessary and recommended to do so.

13. **max\_sessions**
    *   Data Type: Integer
    *   When a user logs into the account, a new session is generated. This field determines that how many sessions can be generated for a single user. This can be changed but is not necessary and recommended to do so.

14. **pp\_width | pp\_height**
    *   Data Type: Integer
    *   This is the size of the profile picture of the user. It is in Pixels.

15. **email\_verification**
    *   Data Type: Boolean
    *   If set to true, only then the functionality of email verification would work.

16. **email\_host | email\_port**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   This field contains the host and the port of the email server to use. These can be changed but are not necessary to do so and can be null if email\_verification is False.

17. **email\_host\_user | email\_host\_password**
    *   Data Type: String
    *   This field contains the email from which to send verification and app password if using Gmail. These must be changed but can be null if email\_verification is False.

# POST Demo Data

This section contains some demo data for the post requests on different endpoints. The demo data is in the form json.

**Note:** Whenever the API must be called on a POST endpoint, the url should always have a "/" at the end.

**Note:** Encryption of Password in the Vault is done on client, not on the server. The "password" field in the json data is already encrypted by the client.
