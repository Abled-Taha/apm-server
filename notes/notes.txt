Changed the Config Loading Class so that it uses config.json for some options and .env for some secrets,
rather than relying on one file for everything. Yet the code is not tested and not even ran once,
as I am facing a problem of having installed a Python version newer than some of the libraries used in this project support.
Maybe I should try switching my Python version to 3.10?
And if that works I can set the Python version in the requirements.txt too for future references.
